## 1. Calculating Regressions

Regressions are fundamental in pricing optimizations. At the core of a regression calculation is the statistical relationship between two variables. In this case, we can use regression to calculate the relationship between price and quantity of a product. Having established a relationship with the regression analysis of past data (past sales quantities at specific prices), we are at a position to make a forecast about the next likely values for both price & quantity based on the trend uncovered by the analysis. 

1. Firstly consider the following data. 

2. Now run a regression on StatPlus or Excel and generate the following scatter chart and coefficients from the report:
